# OpenGL for AutoIt
My attempt at bringing all OpenGL functionality from the MSDN documentation to AutoIt.

__Files:__

OpenGL.au3 - GL - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374211(v=vs.85).aspx

OpenGLU.au3 - GLU - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374158(v=vs.85).aspx

OpenWGL.au3 - WGL & Related Windows functionality - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872083(v=vs.85).aspx

__Trivia:__

OpenGL.au3 & OpenGLU.au3 is made with AutoIt parsing the MSDN documentation to AutoIt and a few corrections made by myself after.

OpenWGL.au3 is made by myself, with the MSDN documentation as refference.
